Find is a program that takes 2 arguments. (string findString, string fileName)
The program finds each time the findString is found inside the file given by fileName.
The program will return each line the findString is found in, and 
at the end the program the number of times the findString was found will be returned.

The algorithm for searching for the findString runs in O(N) time complexity.
Where N is the number of characters in the file.
